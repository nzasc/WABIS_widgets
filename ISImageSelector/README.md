## IS ImageSelector ##
### Overview ###
The IS ImageSelector widget displays all the raster on the current AOI of the primary layer, ordered by user selected field, on a slider or as an dropdown list. As the user moves the slider, the corresponding raster is selected. The user has the option to see the image or footprint of the raster. If the user enters an age, then all the rasters, till the age specified, from the current acquisition date, are selected.
Note the selection is defined at the time when the Image Selector is turned on. This tool only becomes active, if the Primary image layer has TimeInfo. The selection set is based on the current AOI.
